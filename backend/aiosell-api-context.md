# Aiosell API - LLM Context File

> Generated: 2026-09-23. Drop this file into your AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Aider, etc.) as a context/rules file before asking it to write Aiosell integration code.

## Integration Workflow (read this first)

You CAN build the full integration now. You CANNOT make it go live until the user is an onboarded Aiosell partner. Follow this order:

1. **Build now with placeholders.** Write the complete integration code using a placeholder partner id for `{pms}` and placeholder Basic Auth credentials (e.g. `<USERNAME>` / `<PASSWORD>`). Never invent real values, never hard-code anything that looks real.
2. **Tell the user to test the push APIs in the Sandbox.** The Rate Push and Inventory Push APIs can be tried in the Sandbox on the Aiosell docs site before any onboarding. Have the user confirm rates and inventory land on `live.aiosell.com`.
3. **Tell the user to build and test the reservation webhook.** They host one POST endpoint for `book` / `modify` / `cancel`, then exercise it with the Webhook Tester on the docs site.
4. **Tell the user to register as a partner.** Only after registering does Aiosell issue their own partner-level Basic Auth credentials and partner id.
5. **Wait for real credentials.** When the user pastes back their partner id and Basic Auth credentials, swap out the placeholders. Until then, keep placeholders and explicitly prompt the user for the missing values — do not guess them.

## Hard Rules for the AI Reading This File

1. **Do not invent endpoints.** If a URL, method, field, or behavior is not listed in this file, say so explicitly. Do not guess.
2. **Do not invent fields.** Use only the field names exactly as written below. JSON keys are camelCase.
3. **Authentication is HTTP Basic Auth.** Header: `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>`. Do not invent bearer tokens, API keys, JWT, or signing schemes. Credentials are issued by Aiosell only after partner onboarding - use `<USERNAME>` / `<PASSWORD>` placeholders until the user supplies their real values. Never hard-code or guess credential values.
4. **Replace placeholders, don't leave them.** `{pms}` must become the partner id Aiosell assigns at onboarding. `sandbox-pms` is the test hotel code for the sandbox only.
5. **All dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.** Timestamps are `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` unless stated otherwise. No timezone suffix is used.
6. **`startDate`/`endDate` ranges are inclusive on both ends.**
7. **Inventory/rate/restriction pushes are UPSERTS over the date range.** Sending a new value overwrites the prior value for those dates.
8. **Reservation webhooks (`book` / `modify` / `cancel`) all hit the same PMS endpoint** and are differentiated by the `action` field.
9. **`modify` payloads represent the new full state - they are NOT diffs.** Replace, do not merge.
10. **`pah` (Pay-At-Hotel):** `true` = collect at hotel, `false` = already prepaid. Do not infer from amount.
11. **Guest details depend on the OTA and are never guaranteed.** Every `guest.*` field (name, email, phone, address) plus `rooms[].guestName` is optional - each channel decides what it shares, and many mask or withhold contact details. Treat these fields as nullable/absent, never mark them required, and never reject or fail a booking because they are missing.
12. **`specialRequests` is OTA-dependent free text.** It usually holds guest requests, but some channels put other booking information there. It is optional and may be empty, `null`, or missing. Store it as plain text - do not parse it into fields, and do not assume any fixed format.
13. **Restriction fields:** unset = `null`. Do not omit the key - send `null` explicitly.
14. **No-Show (Mark No Show) uses body field `channel` (not `partner`) and currently supports `channel: "booking.com"` and `channel: "gommt"` only.** Do not fabricate other channels.
15. **If asked to generate code, prefer the language/runtime the user is already using.** Always use `Content-Type: application/json` and parse the `success`/`message` response shape.
16. **If a request fails, surface the response body.** Don't suppress errors or retry blindly.
17. **OTA channel keys are lowercase strings.** Allowed in this doc: `agoda`, `airbnb`, `booking.com`, `bookingsmaker`, `cleartrip`, `ctrip`, `easemytrip`, `expedia`, `Goibibo`, `happyeasygo`, `hostelworld`, `hotelbeds`, `MakeMyTrip`, `reconline`, `tiket`, `travelguru`, `traveloka`, `travolounge`, `vhshub`, `travelguru`.

## Base URL

```
https://live.aiosell.com/api/v2/cm
```

Two API directions:
- **PMS to Aiosell (Push):** you call Aiosell. Base URL above.
- **Aiosell to PMS (Webhook):** Aiosell calls a URL YOU host. You provide the URL to Aiosell during onboarding.

## Authentication

Every request uses **HTTP Basic Auth**. Credentials (username + password) are issued by Aiosell only after partner onboarding - they are NOT included in this file. Build with placeholders and prompt the user for their real values once they have registered as a partner.

| Direction | Who sends the header | Credentials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PMS to Aiosell | You send | Issued to you at partner onboarding |
| Aiosell to PMS (webhook) | Aiosell sends | Your endpoint must validate the header before processing |

Use these placeholders until the user supplies real credentials:

```
username: <USERNAME>
password: <PASSWORD>
header:   Authorization: Basic <base64(<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>)>
```

**Encoding the header in code:**

```bash
# curl: use -u
curl -u '<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>' …
```

```js
// JavaScript / Node
const auth = 'Basic ' + btoa('<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>')
fetch(url, { headers: { Authorization: auth, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })
```

```python
# Python
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
requests.post(url, json=payload, auth=HTTPBasicAuth('<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>'))
```

**Validating the inbound webhook on your side:** parse the `Authorization` header, base64-decode it, constant-time compare against your stored credentials. Reject with 401 if it doesn't match.

## Get Property / Mapping Details

- **Method:** `GET`
- **URL:** `https://live.aiosell.com/api/v2/cm/property_details/sandbox-pms?partnerId=sample-pms`
- **Direction:** PMS ← Aiosell (you call Aiosell to fetch your property mapping)

Fetch the full property configuration - hotel id, room codes, and rateplan codes. These are the exact identifiers you must send in every other API, so call this first to build your mapping.

**Notes:**
- Call this FIRST. The `hotel_id`, `room_id`, and `rateplan_id` values returned here are the codes to use as `hotelCode`, `roomCode`, and `rateplanCode` in the Push and Fetch APIs.
- Replace `sandbox-pms` in the path with your hotel code, and `partnerId=sample-pms` with the partner id (`{pms}`) Aiosell assigned you.
- This is a GET request - all parameters go in the URL. There is no request body.

**Headers:**

| Header | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | Yes | `Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hotelCode` | string (path) | Yes | Property identifier, in the URL path. Sandbox value: `sandbox-pms`. |
| `partnerId` | string (query) | Yes | Your partner id ({pms}), passed as a query parameter. Sandbox value: `sample-pms`. |

## Reservation: Book

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `https://sample-pms.com/update_reservation`
- **Direction:** Aiosell to PMS (Aiosell calls your endpoint)

Aiosell calls YOUR webhook endpoint when an OTA booking lands. Your PMS must expose an endpoint and share the URL with Aiosell.

**Notes:**
- This is an inbound webhook FROM Aiosell TO your PMS - you implement the endpoint, Aiosell calls it.
- The same endpoint receives `book`, `modify`, and `cancel` events differentiated by the `action` field.
- Guest details depend on the OTA. Each channel decides how much it shares, and many mask or withhold the email, phone, and address. Treat every `guest.*` field as optional: it may arrive empty, `null`, or missing. Do not require them, and do not reject a booking because they are absent.
- `specialRequests` is free text and its contents depend on the OTA. It usually carries guest requests, but some channels use it for other booking information. Store it as plain text and do not parse it into a fixed structure.

**Headers:**

| Header | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | `application/json` |

| `segment` | string | Yes | Booking category. |
| `specialRequests` | string | null | No | Free-text field. Contents depend on the OTA: usually guest requests, but some channels also place other booking information here. Parse it as plain text and do not rely on a fixed format. |
| `pah` | boolean | Yes | Pay-at-hotel flag. `true` = collect at hotel; `false` = prepaid. |
| `amount.amountAfterTax` | number | Yes | Total with taxes. |
| `amount.amountBeforeTax` | number | Yes | Subtotal. |
| `amount.tax` | number | Yes | Tax amount. |

## Reservation: Cancel

- **Direction:** Aiosell to PMS (Aiosell calls your endpoint)

Cancel a previously booked reservation. Minimal payload.

| `Authorization` | Yes | `Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

## Channel Multiplier

- **Method:** `POST`
- **URL:** `https://live.aiosell.com/api/v2/cm/channel_multiplier/sample-pms`
- **Direction:** PMS to Aiosell (you call Aiosell)

Apply a rate multiplier to a property. Every rate is scaled by the factor before it is distributed to channels - use it for markups or markdowns without re-pushing individual rates.

**Notes:**
- Replace `{pms}` in the URL with the PMS slug Aiosell assigned you (e.g. `sample-pms`).
- `multiplier` is a factor, not a percentage: `1.2` raises rates by 20%, `0.9` lowers them by 10%, `1` leaves them unchanged.
- The multiplier is applied on top of the rates you push - it does not overwrite them.
- `channels` is required and cannot be empty - the multiplier is applied only to the channels you list (e.g. `gommt`, `airbnb`), nothing else.

**Headers:**

| Header | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | `application/json` |
| `Authorization` | Yes | `Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

**Body fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hotelCode` | string | Yes | Property identifier shared by Aiosell. |
| `multiplier` | number | Yes | Rate multiplier factor. `1.2` = +20%, `0.9` = -10%, `1` = no change. |
| `channels` | array<string> | Yes | Non-empty list of channels to apply the multiplier to. Only the listed channels are affected. |

**Sample request:**

```json
{
  "hotelCode": "sandbox-pms",
  "multiplier": 1.25,
  "channels": [
    "gommt",
    "airbnb"
  ]
}
```

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "status": true,
  "message": "Multiplier updated successfully"
}
```

## Quick Guardrails Checklist Before Shipping Integration Code

- [ ] All endpoint URLs match the table above byte-for-byte.
- [ ] PMS slug substituted in `/update/{pms}` and `/update-rates/{pms}`.
- [ ] Dates formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`, timestamps `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`.
- [ ] Optional restriction fields sent as `null`, not omitted.
- [ ] `Content-Type: application/json` set on every request.
- [ ] Response `success` checked; `message` surfaced on failure.
- [ ] Webhook handler is idempotent on `bookingId` (duplicate deliveries possible).
- [ ] `modify` treated as full-replace, not patch.
- [ ] Guest fields treated as optional - no crash or rejection when the OTA withholds them.
- [ ] `specialRequests` stored as free text, not parsed into a fixed structure.
- [ ] No invented fields, partners, or auth schemes.
